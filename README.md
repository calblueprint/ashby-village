**[Ashby Village](http://www.ashbyvillage.org/)** a community of people over age 50 united by our desire to remain in the culturally rich, multigenerational neighborhoods that we know and love. Ashby Village connects members with each other and with the resources they need to remain active and independent. This, coupled with our social program, means every year they contribute $1.5 million in grants and in-kind donations.

What We Are Doing
----
The Schools Fund believed in a mission to encourage a stronger and more involved relationship between teachers and the parents of students. This grant platform is designed to crowdfund donations towards teacher projects while targeting a specific audience. In the future, the Schools Fund will use this application to replace their entire grant application system.

**[Cal Blueprint](http://www.calblueprint.org/)** is a student-run UC Berkeley organization devoted to matching the skills of its members to our desire to see social good enacted in our community. Each semester, teams of 4-5 students work closely with a non-profit to bring technological solutions to the problems they face every day.
